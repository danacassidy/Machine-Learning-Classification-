I love the way the story displays how there is no \"just bouncing back\" from being sexually assaulted.  Mia showed us how those demons come for you every day and how sometimes they best you. I was so in the moment with Broken World and hurt with Mia because she was surrounded by people but so alone and I understood her feelings.  I found myself wishing I could give her some of my courage and strength or even just to be there for her.  Thank you Lizzy for putting a great character\\'s voice on a strong subject and making it so that other peoples story may be heard through Mia\\'s.'"

      "If I were younger I might have enjoyed The Promise of Amazing more. It was just a lot of teenage stuff that didn't always make sense, but if I were a teen I might not have minded it. Usually it is fine, either the characters don't seem as young, or they seem realistic, so I don't mind. This wasn't a horrible book, I have read way worse, it just wasn't that good either.Wren had a boyfriend then they broke up when he went away to college. Apparently that equals humping and dumping (really I thought as soon as they had sex they broke up, but when you find out it is when they are talking about him going off to college well...these things happen). So she is kind of over guys.Grayson was the popular guy, but he also did lots of not good things. Things that would put him in jail if he got caught. Not the worst things, like killing people, but he really isn't a good guy. Then he gets expelled from his fancy school so he decides he needs to change.Wren and Grayson meet when Wren is working a wedding he is attending. He is a jerk jock guy and starts choking on a mini hot dog after trying to show off. She does the Heimlich on him and saves him. There is just something magical about the way her arms wrapped around him and...yeah no. Doing the Heimlich maneuver is not sexy. I could see like he was so thankful to her he wanted to take her out to show her how appreciative he is or something. Not when your arms were around me and I was choking it was kind of hot. Sure thing. So right from the start I knew not really the book for me.Before the choking incident Wren did think how Grayson was kind of a jerk. Then when they meet up again she still thinks it, but he is so dreamy so she can't stay away. It was just odd. Like she didn't seem to like him, she just thought he was hot. Somehow that equaled her falling in love with him. Really I didn't connect much with either character and didn't know what either of them liked the other. Grayson does try to change, and they do start dating, but then once she finds out his past she is put off again. Her friend were all so what? Everyone has a past. He hasn't done that in like 2 months since he started dating you so who cares. It was just another odd moment. I felt like the friends shouldn't really be pushing her towards him once they know what was going on. It just seemed really fake.Then *spoilers ahead* the ending. Ugh. So Luke kept trying to break up Wren and Grayson because he wants the old Grayson back. He wants Grayson to continue what they had been doing before he got expelled. So it comes to a climax at the end where Grayson has finally had enough, the cops show up and it is not that good. I thought great, finally he is no longer friends with Luke. Then Luke shows up at his door all alright, it's cool, I get it. You are not going back to the way things were. I have moved on. Then they are bff again. I was just like really? After everything that went down you just say cool bro glad to have you back. You are not at all upset that he kissed your girlfriend, threatened you, tried to break you guys up and get you in trouble with the law? You don't care? Okay. But if someone was harassing me for months I wouldn't forgive so easily. So yeah. Not the best book.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland\n",
