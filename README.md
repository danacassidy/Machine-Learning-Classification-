# Machine-Learning-Classification-
I built a model that automatically classifies text as having either a negative or positive sentiment using amazon reviews as the training data.

The project idea comes from Keith Galli. 



Data directory contains several files of 1000+ amazon reviews across different departments. The raw data can be found here: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/
